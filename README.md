```
Welcome to adaway-linux, a small script to add domains hosting ads to the hosts file to block them.

[!] Please run ./install.sh before using this! It will backup your original /etc/hosts

Usage:
You have only to run this script to add the ad-domains to your hosts file or to update them.
Parameters:
    -h    --help      show help
    -s    --simulate  simulate, but don't replace /etc/hosts
```

## How it works
All ad hosting domains will be listed in `/etc/hosts` and therefore any request to them will be redirected to a dummy IP (`0.0.0.0`).
The list of blocked domains is fetched and can be updated from servers listed in `./hostssources.lst`.

## Drawbacks
+ theoretical it should work fine, but it's difficult to get all domains witch host advertisements
+ `/etc/hosts` file may be very confusing
+ if you want to add or remove something manually from `/etc/hosts`, you have to do this in the backup file (`/etc/.hosts.original`)
+ maybe plugins like [uBlock origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) will work better as they remove placeholders, too.
